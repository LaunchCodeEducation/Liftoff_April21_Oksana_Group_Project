# Liftoff_April21_Oksana_Group_Project


We are creating this application to make the process of locating trails more simple and efficient 
for users by locating a specific feature of a trail.

Users can search by name and/or location (city, state, or zipcode), include tags like “allows
pets”, “children friendly”, “rivers”, “paved/ asphalt”, “dirt”, etc.), and users can also narrow 
search results by selecting the desired duration of trails. In addition, users have the ability 
to leave reviews and recommendations for trails they have visited. Users will also have the ability 
to plan a “meetup”  by date, time, and trail location with other users.

This idea came from sharing the same desire to find local hiking trails that fitted specific needs.
