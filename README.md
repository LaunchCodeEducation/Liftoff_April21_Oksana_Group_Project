# Liftoff April 2021: Trail Tracker
## Diana Che, Julie Emily, Jermell Howard, Jr., John Schwartz
We are creating this application to make the process of locating trails more simple and efficient for users searching for a specific feature of a trail. 

Users will be able to search by name and/or location, and filter by features like “allows pets”, “children friendly”, “rivers”, “paved/ asphalt”, “dirt”, etc. Users will also be able to narrow search results by selecting the desired duration of trails. In addition, users will have the ability to leave reviews and recommendations for trails they have visited. Users will also have the ability to plan a “meetup”  by date, time, and trail location with other users.

Trail data was compiled from hikingproject.com, alltrails.com, and greatriversgreenway.org.

### Planned Features
- Search: Users will be able to search for specific trials by text, location, tags, or duration.
- Write Review: Users will be able to leave a review about a specific trail when logged in and rate it (1-5 stars). 
- User Login: Users will be able to create an account to access features such as leaving a review or favoriting a trail and viewing all user reviews.
- Meetup: Users will be able to plan to meet with other users at certain trail by location, date and time
